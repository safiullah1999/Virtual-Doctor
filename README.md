# Virtual-Doctor
Virtual Doctor is a React Based Web application to digitize communication between the doctor and the patient. This app uses Blockchain to secure patient's and doctor's information. The main feature of this application are: login authentication, online appointment with doctors, providing prescriptions, create reports, deleting patient or doctor by admin. This application consists of three users Admin, Doctor and Patients. The admin only has the rights to add and remove other users, and has no access to any of the patientâ€™s health information. Admin only manages add user, remove user, and password change requests in the system. The second type of user in our system is the patient, the patient has the rights to view his medical information and set appointments, the patient cannot alter his medical information. Once data is added on the Blockchain it cannot me change in any ways. The third type of user in our system is the doctor, the doctor has the rights to view his appointments, prescribe medicines and create patient report. Only doctor is the one who has the right to add reports of the patient. Our smart contract also uses the modifier of OnlyDoctor which make sure that doctor is the only one who can add medical information of the patient.
